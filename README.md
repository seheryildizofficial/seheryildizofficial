👋 Hi, I’m Seher Yıldız
📚I'm currently learning frontend and React development
🎯In this training, I aim to specialize in React and JavaScript.
📍I highly value learning new things and improving my skills, and I believe in the instructiveness of human relationships for this purpose. Therefore, exchanging knowledge with the people on my team is very important to me. As someone curious about learning,Michelangelo's motto "I am still learning" has become my own motto.
✨You can review the projects I did during my education.Thank you.
