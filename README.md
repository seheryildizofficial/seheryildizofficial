👋 Hi, I’m Seher Yıldız </br>
📚I'm currently learning frontend and React development </br>
🎯In this training, I aim to specialize in React and JavaScript. </br>
📍I highly value learning new things and improving my skills, and I believe in the instructiveness of human relationships for this purpose. </br> 🌈Therefore, exchanging knowledge with the people on my team is very important to me. </br> 💫As someone curious about learning,Michelangelo's motto "I am still learning" has become my own motto. </br>
✨You can review the projects I did during my education.</br> Thank you.</br>
